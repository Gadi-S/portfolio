# Gadiel Shepherd — Post Graduate Program in AI/ML: Business Applications - Portfolio

Welcome! This repository contains my portfolio of data science / machine learning / analytics projects completed in the [AI/ML post graduate program](https://onlineexeced.mccombs.utexas.edu/online-ai-machine-learning-course) delivered by The University of Texas at Austin: McCombs School of Business in collaboration with Great Learning.
I’m passionate about turning data into insights, building models, and telling stories with visualization.

## 🔍 Evaluator Feedback

### Project 1 EDA 
> **Grade: 60/60** <br><br>
> “We’re pleased to inform you that after a thorough review, your project stands out. The content is well-executed, and you’ve effectively handled all of our inquiries.
Thank you for your work!”

### Project 2 Machine Learning 
> **Grade: 60/60** <br><br>
> “You’ve put together a very solid and well-structured notebook. Each section is thoughtfully done, and there’s a strong connection between your technical work and practical application. Great job staying focused and detailed—this is a well-rounded project!”

### Project 3 Advanced Machine Learning 
> **Grade: 60/60** <br><br>
> “Excellent work, Gadiel! You’ve demonstrated a full understanding of the ML workflow and delivered a business-focused solution with consistency and clarity. Your effort really shines—keep up the fantastic work!”

### Project 4 Neural Networks 
> **Grade: 60/60** <br><br>
> “Your assignment submission is nothing short of outstanding. You've demonstrated an impressive level of proficiency by completing every required step with precision and attention to detail. The clarity in your explanations and the alignment with the assignment criteria are both top-notch. Congratulations on securing a perfect score of 60! Your commitment to academic excellence is evident and deeply appreciated.”

### Project 5 NLP with GenAI 
> **Grade: 58/60** <br><br>
> “Excellent work on this assignment! You successfully loaded the LLM from Hugging Face, defined a custom function for parameter settings, and efficiently answered the problem statement questions. Your prompt engineering and parameter tuning across multiple combinations were well executed, and you included key observations for each response. The RAG pipeline was correctly implemented with proper data preparation, embeddings, vector storage, and retriever configuration. Question answering using RAG was thorough, with observations added for each response, and the output evaluation was carefully conducted. While actionable insights were provided, including recommendations would have made your analysis even stronger. Overall, the notebook is clear, logically structured, and easy to follow.”

### Project 6 Computer Vision with CNN 
> **Grade: 57/60** <br><br>
> “This is an outstanding submission that demonstrates strong technical competence in computer vision and deep learning. Your implementation of all four models was executed correctly with appropriate architectures, configurations, and training procedures. The code quality is excellent with proper preprocessing, data splitting, and model evaluation practices. <br><br>
What truly distinguishes this work is your critical analytical thinking—particularly your identification and consistent discussion of dataset bias throughout the assignment. Your observation that models might be learning context and scale patterns rather than actual helmet detection shows sophisticated understanding beyond mere implementation. The insights about shortcut learning and generalization concerns demonstrate real-world awareness that many students miss.”
