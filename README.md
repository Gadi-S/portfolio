## ðŸ“‚ How This Is Organized

Each project is stored in its own folder (e.g. `project1-name/`). Inside:
- `notebook.ipynb` â€” the original Jupyter notebook.
- `export.html` â€” an HTML version of the notebook for easy viewing.
- `data/` â€” data files (if included).
- `src/` â€” helper modules or scripts.
- `README.md` â€” project-specific documentation (motivation, instructions, results).

The `docs/` folder contains files used for GitHub Pages, including:
- `index.html` â€” homepage for portfolio.
- `projects/` â€” HTML exports of each project for online viewing.
